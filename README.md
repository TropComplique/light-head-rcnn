This is an implementation of [Light-Head R-CNN: In Defense of Two-Stage Object Detector](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.07264).  
Note that this code is failed to reproduce the results from the paper.

## Requirements
1. tensorflow 1.12
2. numpy, Pillow, tqdm, pycocotools, opencv

### Credit
This implementation is heavily inspired by:
1. [Tensorflow Object Detection API](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/object_detection)
2. [zengarden/light_head_rcnn](https://github.com/zengarden/light_head_rcnn)
